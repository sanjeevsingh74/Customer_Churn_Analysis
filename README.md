# 📊 Customer Churn Analysis  

## 📝 Project Description  
Customer churn is a critical business issue, especially in subscription-based industries. This project analyzes customer churn data using **Python (Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn), and Excel** to identify patterns and gain insights.  

By performing **data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis (EDA), and visualization**, this project aims to help businesses **reduce customer churn** through actionable insights.  

---

## 🔍 Project Overview  
The main objectives of this analysis are:  
✔ **Data Cleaning & Preprocessing** – Handling missing values, correcting data types, and ensuring consistency.  
✔ **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** – Finding trends and key factors influencing customer churn.  
✔ **Data Visualization** – Creating graphs and charts for better interpretation.  
✔ **Business Insights** – Understanding customer behavior and possible retention strategies.

📊 Key Insights from Analysis
🔹 High Churn Rate: Customers with month-to-month contracts and no online security services are more likely to leave.
🔹 Billing Factor: Churn rate is higher among customers with paperless billing.
🔹 Senior Citizens: Older customers have a slightly higher churn percentage compared to younger customers.
🔹 Tenure Impact: Long-term customers are less likely to churn than new ones.
